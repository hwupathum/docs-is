# Authenticating AI agents
<!-- vale on -->

This guide walks you through how to authenticate AI agents into your applications secured by **{{ product_name }}**. It covers two key authentication scenarios:

* When an AI agent acts independently
* When an AI agent acts on behalf of a user

<!-- vale off -->
Each scenario leverages standard or emerging OAuth 2.0-based protocols to ensure secure and scalable access delegation.

## AI agent acting on its own
<!-- vale on -->

In this scenario, the AI agent operates autonomously without user involvement, supporting background processes, monitoring tasks, and independently running automation workflows.

When acting on its own, the AI agent uses its **Agent ID** and **Agent Secret** to authenticate with the authorization server and obtain an access token.

* The AI agent begins the authentication flow by initiating an authorize request.

```java
curl --location '{{api_base_path}}/oauth2/authorize' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=vMH8K3zdIhlSiIDmmvnebNOI_bIa' \
--data-urlencode 'response_type=code' \
--data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=https://example.com/callback' \
--data-urlencode 'scope=read_bookings write_bookings' \
--data-urlencode 'response_mode=direct' \
--data-urlencode 'resource=booking_api'
```

The agent receives the following response that contains key components like the **flowId** parameter that uniquely identifies the login flow and the authenticators array that contains the authentication options available for the first step.

```js
{
  "flowId": "3bd1f207-e5b5-4b45-8a91-13b0acfb2151",
  "flowStatus": "INCOMPLETE",
  "flowType": "AUTHENTICATION",
  "nextStep": {
    "stepType": "AUTHENTICATOR_PROMPT",
    "authenticators": [
      {
        "authenticatorId": "QmFzaWNBdXRoZW50aWNhdG9yOkxPQ0FM",
        "authenticator": "Username & Password",
        "idp": "LOCAL",
        "metadata": {
          "i18nKey": "authenticator.basic",
          "promptType": "USER_PROMPT",
          "params": [
            {
              "param": "username",
              "type": "STRING",
              "isConfidential": false,
              "order": 1,
              "i18nKey": "param.username"
            }
          ]
        },
        "requiredParams": [
          "username",
          "password"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "acceptErrorParams": false,
    "messages": [
      {
        "type": "ERROR",
        "messageId": "msg_invalid_un_pw",
        "message": "Invalid username or password.",
        "i18nKey": "message.msg_invalid_un_pw",
        "context": [
          {
            "key": "remainingAttempts",
            "value": "2"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "authentication",
      "href": "/api/authenticate/v1",
      "method": "POST"
    }
  ]
}
```

* The agent makes a POST request to the `/authn` endpoint using the Authentication API. The payload of this request includes the flowId and the selectedAuthenticator object which contains credentials for the user-selected authentication option.

```bash
curl --location '{{ api_base_path }}/oauth2/authn' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"flowId": "3bd1f207-e5b5-4b45-8a91-13b0acfb2151",
"selectedAuthenticator": {
    "authenticatorId": "QmFzaWNBdXRoZW50aWNhdG9yOkxPQ0FM",
    "params": {
        "username": "<agent_id>",
        "password": "<agent_secret>"

    }
}
}'
```

If the request is successful, the agent will receive a response with the following format.

```js
{
   "code": "6ff8b7e1-01fc-39b9-b56d-a1f5826e6d2a",
   "state": "logpg",
   "session_state": "43b1ffc92c8d349942e99bd0270fca05f934ad6f612b27f40a5fa60b96bd0iD4RK8Etr4XruxnYMEvcKQ"
}
```

* As the final step, the agent sends a token request with the received authorization code to the authorization server’s token endpoint, using its own credentials (Agent ID and Secret). The server verifies these credentials, and upon successful authentication, issues an access token. The agent then includes this access token in its requests to securely access protected resources.

```bash
curl --location '{{ api_base_path }}/oauth2/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=vMH8K3zdIhlSiIDmmvnebNOI_bIa' \
--data-urlencode 'code=3a23a94a-3c50-3b56-92fa-f583cb63c617' \
--data-urlencode 'code_verifier=FehTNaOvDMhpP9wgdGb_AWR5Gu5KwTmF978KMRKbtgM' \
--data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=https://example.com/callback' \
--data-urlencode 'resource=booking_api'
```

## AI agent acting on behalf of a user

When an AI agent needs to act on behalf of a user—such as initiating a transaction, making a booking, or retrieving user-specific data—it must do so with explicit user consent. This is typically required for user-facing assistants, copilots, or delegated decision-making agents.

This scenario follows an enhanced authorization code flow, inspired by the [OAuth for AI Agents IETF draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-oauth-ai-agents-on-behalf-of-user/), which introduces a structured delegation model using an `actor_token`.

![Agent Acting on-behalf-of User Flow Diagram](../../../assets/img/guides/agentic-ai/ai-agent-on-behalf-flow.png)

As shown in the above sequence diagram, the flow proceeds as follows.

1. **Delegation Initiation**
   The user initiates a delegation request—via a user interface or API—specifying that a particular AI agent (`Actor ID`) is permitted to act on their behalf.

2. **Initial Unauthorized Attempt**
   The agent attempts to access a protected resource but receives a `401 Unauthorized` response, as it lacks the necessary credentials to act on behalf of the user.

3. **Authentication and Consent Redirection**
   The client redirects the user to the Authorization Server (AS), including the `requested_actor` parameter (which identifies the AI agent) along with standard OAuth parameters such as the client ID, redirect URI, and requested scopes.

4. **User Authentication and Consent**
   The user logs in to the Authorization Server and is presented with a consent screen that clearly indicates the scopes being requested and the identity of the AI agent attempting to act on their behalf. If the user approves, the delegation is successfully established.

5. **Additional Consent (If Required)**
   If the AI agent later attempts an action requiring scopes not previously granted, the resource server may return a `403 Forbidden` with a list of missing scopes. The client can then initiate a follow-up consent flow to obtain user approval for these additional scopes.

6. **Authorization Code Exchange**
   After consent, the client receives an authorization code. It then exchanges this code at the token endpoint, attaching the AI agent’s own `actor_token` (acquired separately using its credentials) in the `Authorization` header.

7. **Token Issuance**
   The Authorization Server verifies both the user’s authorization code and the agent’s actor token, and issues a delegated JWT access token that encapsulates the user-agent relationship.

8. **Authorized Request Retry**
   The client retries the original request using the new access token, which now represents both the user and the authorized agent.

9. **Successful Access**
   The request succeeds. The AI agent is now authorized to act on the user’s behalf and access the required resources.
