AI agents are transforming how organizations automate processes and interact with users. Just like human users or applications, AI agents need secure, managed identities to access resources and perform actions on themselves, or behalf of users or organizations. {{ product_name }}'s Agentic AI Identity feature provides first-class identity management for AI agents, enabling secure authentication, authorization, access control, and auditability of automated systems.

{{ product_name }}'s Agentic AI Identity feature provides:

- **Unique Agent Identities** - Each AI agent gets a distinct identity with specific attributes and metadata.
- **Credential Management** - Support for multiple authentication methods, including client credentials and JWT.
- **Access Control** - Fine-grained permissions and role-based access control for agent operations.
- **Audit & Compliance** - Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring of agent activities for compliance.

## Agent Identity Needs

### Why AI Agents Need Identity

AI agents operate autonomously and require secure access to:

- **Tools, APIs, and microservices** to perform business operations
- **Data sources** to retrieve and process information
- **External systems** to integrate with third-party services
- **User resources** when acting on behalf of authenticated users

### Key Requirements

- **Security**: Each agent must have unique, verifiable credentials that cannot be compromised or shared.
- **Governance**: Organizations need visibility into agent activities, permissions, and resource access.
- **Scalability**: Identity management must support hundreds or thousands of agents without operational overhead.
- **Compliance**: Agent identities must adhere to regulatory requirements and security policies.
- **Auditability**: All agent actions must be logged and traceable for security and compliance purposes.
