# Email domain based organization discovery

In Business-to-Business (B2B) applications, seamlessly authenticating users from external organizations remains essential. This ensures a smooth user experience.

One way to achieve this involves **email domain-based organization discovery**. With this feature, your application can provide a customized login experience. The experience depends on the domain of the user's email address.

For example, when users log in with an `@xyz.com` email address, the system automatically redirects them to the login screen customized for the `XYZ` organization. This provides a familiar and consistent experience.

This guide explains how you may use {{product_name}} to configure email domain-based organization discovery for your B2B applications.

## Scenario

**Guardio Insurance** serves as an insurance provider. *Best Car Mart* and *Glory Car Mart* represent two of its customer organizations.

When a user enters an email address to log into the Guardio Insurance platform, the system needs to resolve the user's organization. It does this based on the email domain. Then it redirects them to the respective organization's login screen.

![Email domain based organization discovery scenario]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/organization/manage-organizations/email-domain-based-organization-discovery.png){: width="700" style="display: block; margin: 0;"}

In this example scenario:

- User Alice with email `alice@bcmart.com` should go to the login screen of `Best Car Mart` organization.
- User Bob and Ben, with emails `bob@gcmart.com` and `ben@glory.com` should go to the login screen of `Glory Car Mart` organization.

## Enable email domain based organization discovery

!!! note "Important"
    - The root organization only permits enabling this feature and mapping email domains to organizations.
    {% if product_name == "WSO2 Identity Server" %}
    - For this feature to work, make sure to [enable email address as the username]({{base_path}}/guides/users/attributes/enable-email-as-username/) so that users may log in to applications with their email addresses.
    {% endif %}

=== "Using the Console"

    To do so,

    1. Login to the root organization Console.
    2. Navigate to **Login & Registration**, and under **Organization Settings**, click **Organization Discovery**.
    3. Turn the toggle on to enable email domain based organization discovery.

        ![Enable email domain based organization discovery]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/organization/manage-organizations/enable-email-domain-based-organization-discovery.png){: width="700" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    {% if (product_name == "WSO2 Identity Server") %}

    4. Select the **Email domain discovery for self-registration** checkbox if you want to allow users to discover organizations based on their email domain and self-register in them.

        !!! note
            For this to work, child organizations should have self-registration enabled. Currently, you can enable self-registration for all child organizations by adding the following configuration to the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

            ```
            [identity_mgt.user_self_registration]
            allow_self_registration = true
            ```

    {% endif %}

    5. [Map email domains to organizations](#map-email-domains-to-organizations).

=== "Using the API"

    To do so,

    1. [Get an access token]({{base_path}}/apis/#oauth-based-authentication) with the `internal_organization_config_add` scope.

    2. Use the obtained access token to execute the following command.

        ``` curl
        curl --location --request POST 'https://{{ host_name }}{{ organization_path_param }}/api/server/v1/organization-configs/discovery' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
        --data '{
            "properties": [
                {
                    "key": "emailDomain.enable",
                    "value": true
                }
            ]
        }'
        ```

    5. [Map email domains to organizations](#map-email-domains-to-organizations).

## Map email domains to organizations

Mapping an email domain to an organization allows for a customized user experience, but this remains optional. When an organization lacks a mapped email domain, the behavior changes as follows:

- If an organization registers an email domain mapping,
  - a user can only onboard to the organization if the user's email domain matches one of the domains claimed by the organization.
  {% if product_name == "Asgardeo" or (product_name == "WSO2 Identity Server" and is_version != "7.0.0") %}
  - The system restricts federated authentication and Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning for users logging in with email domains not claimed by the organization.
  {% else %}
  - Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning during federated authentication only occurs if the user's email domain matches one of the domains claimed by the organization.
  {% endif %}
- If not, a user can register to the organization with an email address of any domain (other than the domains claimed by other organizations).

=== "Using the Console"

    !!! note

        {% if product_name == "WSO2 Identity Server" and is_version == "7.0.0" %}
        In {{product_name}} {{is_version}} from update level **7.0.0.88** onwards (Updates 2.0 model), you can bypass the `Sign In With SSO` page and go directly to your organization's login page by adding the following query parameters in the login request.
        {% else %}
        You can bypass the `Sign In With SSO` page and go directly to your organization's login page by adding the following query parameters in the login request.
        {% endif %} 
        
        - `login_hint`: The email address of the user that will be used to resolve the domain.
        - `fidp`: If you have additional B2C login options configured for the application, you can set this parameter to `OrganizationSSO` to direct users straight to the organization login page.


        Sample requests:

        === "OIDC"
            
            ```curl
