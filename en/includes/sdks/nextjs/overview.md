## Contexts

The SDK provides a context-based architecture, allowing you to easily manage authentication state and user data across your application. The main context is provided by the `AsgardeoProvider`, which wraps your application and provides access to authentication methods and user information.

- **`AsgardeoProvider`** – The main provider component that wraps your application, providing authentication context and configuration.

## Components

The Asgardeo Next.js SDK provides a comprehensive set of components to handle authentication, user management, and organization features in your Next.js applications. The components are organized into different categories based on their functionality.

### Action Components

Action components trigger specific authentication-related actions when users interact with them.

- **`SignInButton`** – A customizable button that initiates the sign-in flow.
- **`SignUpButton`** – A button for user registration flows.
- **`SignOutButton`** – A button that handles user sign-out.

These components support both render props and traditional props patterns, giving you flexibility in how you implement them.

### Control Components

Control components manage the conditional rendering of content based on authentication state.

- **`SignedIn`** – Renders children only when the user is authenticated.
- **`SignedOut`** – Renders children only when the user is not authenticated.
- **`Loading`** – Shows loading state during authentication operations.

### User Self-care Components

- **`User`** – Provides render props access to user data.
- **`UserProfile`** – Displays comprehensive user profile information.
- **`UserDropdown`** – A dropdown menu with user info and actions.

- **`OrganizationProfile`** – Shows detailed organization profile.
- **`OrganizationSwitcher`** – Allows switching between organizations.

- **`CreateOrganization`** – Form for creating new organizations.

### Authentication Components

- **`SignIn`** – Complete sign-in form with multiple authentication options.
- **`SignUp`** – User registration form.
