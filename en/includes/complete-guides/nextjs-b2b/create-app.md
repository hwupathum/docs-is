Letâ€™s walk through setting up a Next.js application. Next.js is a React framework that simplifies creating web applications with features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).

Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you'd like to create your project, and run the following command to set up a Next.js project:

Running the above command will generate a new folder named Teamspace, containing a ready-to-use Next.js project set up with TypeScript. The project includes a development server that automatically reloads the app whenever changes are made.

=== "npm"

    ``` bash
    npm create next-app@latest Teamspace -- --yes
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ``` bash
    yarn create next-app@latest Teamspace -- --yes
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ``` bash
    pnpm create next-app@latest Teamspace -- --yes
    ```

Once the application is created, navigate to the app folder. Then run the sample in the development mode. This allows you to see real-time updates and debug the app as you make changes.

=== "npm"

    ``` bash
    cd Teamspace
    npm run dev
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ``` bash
    cd Teamspace
    yarn dev
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ``` bash
    cd Teamspace
    pnpm dev
    ```

This will start the Next.js development server, typically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000){:target="_blank"}, and you should see the default Next.js starter page. Confirm that everything is set up correctly by checking for the terminal output indicating that the server is running.

At this point, you have a simple Next.js app. Now, it's time to integrate {{product_name}} within the application.
